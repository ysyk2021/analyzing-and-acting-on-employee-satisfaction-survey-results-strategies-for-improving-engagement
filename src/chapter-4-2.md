Clear and concise language helps ensure that survey results are easily understood by all stakeholders, regardless of their level of expertise or familiarity with survey data. It enables stakeholders to quickly identify key findings, understand the implications of those findings, and develop actionable strategies for improvement.

Using clear and concise language also helps build trust and transparency among stakeholders. It demonstrates a commitment to open communication and a willingness to share information openly and honestly. This can help improve employee engagement and retention by building a culture of trust and accountability.

When communicating survey results, it is important to tailor the message to different stakeholders. This may involve using different language, emphasizing different findings, and highlighting different implications of survey data based on the stakeholder's role and responsibilities.
