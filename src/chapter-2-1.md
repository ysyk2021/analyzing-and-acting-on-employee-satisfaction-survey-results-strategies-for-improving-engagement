Chapter 2: Overview of Employee Satisfaction Surveys: Different Types of Employee Satisfaction Surveys
======================================================================================================

Employee satisfaction surveys are a critical tool for organizations that want to improve employee engagement and retention. In this chapter, we will discuss the various types of employee satisfaction surveys.

Attitude Surveys
----------------

Attitude surveys are the most common type of employee satisfaction survey. They measure employees' attitudes towards their work, colleagues, management, and overall job satisfaction. These surveys typically include questions about work-life balance, job security, compensation, benefits, communication, and opportunities for career growth.

Pulse Surveys
-------------

Pulse surveys are shorter and more frequent than attitude surveys. They provide real-time insights into employee morale and engagement. These surveys are designed to be quick and easy to complete, with just a few questions that can be answered in a minute or less. Pulse surveys can help organizations identify areas of concern quickly and take action to address them.

Onboarding Surveys
------------------

Onboarding surveys are given to new employees to gauge their satisfaction with the onboarding process. These surveys can help organizations identify areas where the onboarding process can be improved and ensure that new employees have a positive experience from the start.

Exit Surveys
------------

Exit surveys are given to departing employees to understand why they are leaving and what could be done to retain them. These surveys can provide valuable insights into issues such as leadership, work culture, compensation, and benefits. By understanding why employees are leaving, organizations can develop strategies to improve retention.

360-Degree Surveys
------------------

360-degree surveys allow employees to receive feedback from their managers, peers, subordinates, and customers. These surveys can provide a comprehensive view of an employee's performance, strengths, and areas for improvement. By using 360-degree surveys, organizations can develop targeted training and development programs to help employees grow and improve.

By understanding the various types of employee satisfaction surveys, organizations can choose the most appropriate survey for their needs and gather valuable insights to improve engagement and retention.
