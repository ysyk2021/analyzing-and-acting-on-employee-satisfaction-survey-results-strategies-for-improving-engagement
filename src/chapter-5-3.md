Chapter 5: Developing Action Plans to Address Survey Results: Creating SMART Goals
==================================================================================

Once an organization has analyzed the results of an employee satisfaction survey, the next step is to develop an action plan to address identified issues. In this chapter, we will discuss how to create SMART goals as part of an action plan.

What are SMART Goals?
---------------------

SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. They provide a clear and concise framework for developing actionable steps to address identified issues.

### Specific

Specific goals are clearly defined and focused. They answer the questions who, what, when, where, and why. For example, "Increase communication between managers and employees by implementing weekly one-on-one meetings."

### Measurable

Measurable goals include specific metrics that can be tracked and evaluated over time. For example, "Increase employee satisfaction with communication from 60% to 80% within six months."

### Attainable

Attainable goals are realistic and achievable. They take into account available resources and any potential barriers. For example, "Implement a new training program for managers within the next year to improve leadership skills."

### Relevant

Relevant goals are aligned with organizational objectives and the needs of employees. They address the most significant issues identified in the survey results. For example, "Improve work-life balance by offering flexible scheduling options to employees."

### Time-Bound

Time-bound goals have a specific deadline for completion. This helps ensure accountability and keeps the focus on achieving the goal within a reasonable timeframe. For example, "Reduce turnover rate by 10% within the next 12 months."

Benefits of Using SMART Goals

Using SMART goals as part of an action plan has several benefits, including:

* Providing a clear and concise framework for developing actionable steps.
* Ensuring that goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.
